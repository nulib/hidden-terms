# Terms Hidden in PrimoVE at NUL
The December 2021 Primo VE release includes a new feature, Option to Hide Offensive Subject Terms to Support Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Primo/Release_Notes/002Primo_VE/2021/010Primo_VE_2021_Release_Notes

This repository is to track the list of terms hidden in Northwestern's PrimoVE as a text file.

In addition, we've added the "unambiguous terms" in this script by kheslin0420 originally from hatebase: https://github.com/kheslin0420/kheslin0420.github.io/blob/master/Legacy_Description_Audit/FA_audit_script.py
